        <p>I am going to school to get my degree in software engineering with the hopes to someday work in the cybersecurity industry.</p>
        <p>I have a ton of hobbies. Some of my hobbies include wakeboarding, longboarding, fishing, hunting, doing basically anything outside and hanging with my friends.</p>
        <p>My favorite scripture is Exodus 14:14. It says, "The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.." </p>
